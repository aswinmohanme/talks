# How it all started
* Heavy Rainfall 

* Human Error

* Climate Change and Dams

# August 11
* Flood starts turning bad

* Kerala Rescue is born from a simple django form

# Initial Requirements
1. A form where the people or camps would specify their needs eg water, medicines etc.

2. There will be a contact part where there will be contacts of 2 or 3 people from each district who would coordinate the same.

3. Any volunteer who would like to help should be able to view all the items that are in need at various places or suitably places close to him/her.

4. The needs that have been supplied a
Should be marked as supplied so that there wonâ€™t be too much of that either

# August 12 - 14
* Tons of Rescue Requests

* Tons of Open Source Contributors 

* Tons of Features and Bug fixes

# August 15 

## Kerala Flood Map
* A website for getting the locations of the people who needs rescue.

* Also gets the current location of the rescuer so the nearest person who needs rescue can easily be found out

* Uses firebase to track requests

* Independent of Kerala Rescue

# August 16 - First Half
* Still independent of Kerala Rescue

* Still working with an external database

* Still usimg Google Maps for displaying the Map
