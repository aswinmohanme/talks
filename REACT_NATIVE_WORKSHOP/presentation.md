## React Native
Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React, using a single codebase.

## Prerequisites
* `node -v`

* `expo --version`


# Tools of the Trade

## Javascript
* High level, intrepeted programming language

* Cross Platform to the core

* Powers the modern and antique web

* Pretty dumb though, so we add more features on top of the language

## Node
* JS could only run in the browser once, node changed that.

* Gives access to a whole lot of packages created by the community.

## React
* Facebook needed thier website to be fast

* React is fast

* Virtual Dom !

## React Native
* React on Mobile

* Growing ecosystem

* Way simpler than Native development

* Access to entire JS ecosystem

## Expo
* Built on top of React Native

* Makes RN development so much simpler

## Hello React Native

* Build a RN app to display Hello React Native

## Exercise
* Modify the RN app to display Hello Your Name

## Color Changing Christmas

* Build a React Native App to change the color of the square box when tapped

## JSX
* Like HTML but compiles down to JS

* Syntax sugar for easier development

## Style
* Each element has it's own styles

* RN uses units not pixels

* Layout with Flexbox (will explain later)

## Exercise
* Add a button to change the color 

* Get the color from the user input

* Increase the font size (ask google for help)

## Calculate like a Calculator
* Build an RN Calculator

## Layout with Flexbox
* Easiest layout paradigm on the planet

## Composition and Code Splitting
* Split code into modules for reuse

* Class based components and Functional components

## Props
* Pass data to those components

## Stateful and Stateless Widgets
* Update on state change

* Core of React
