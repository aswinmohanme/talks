<Notes>
you come up with crappy ideas, when you look for them
look for problems, they will surely fulfill a need when you come out with the app
long term solution
</Notes>

* everything begins with an Idea
* but ideas begin with problems

</Notes>

## everything begins with problems
* notice the problems around you
* write down those problems
* review those problems and try to come up with solutions
* consider which solutions can be processes
* see if the process can be built as an app
---
## that's the best way to come up with apps that people will use


---
# wireframing / designing
---
* this is where you decide how your app is going to look
* which platforms (web, mobile) it will be running on
* just sketch out some rough sketches on how you want your app to look
* don't stress too much on design


---
# code
---
* you need somebody to code the app
* either you learn it or get somebody who knows


---
# ship it
---
* once you have finished it, just launch
* you can launch on producthunt.com and get a lot of early adopters


---
# marketing
---
* don't concentrate too much on marketing
* improve your app and let the market take care of the rest
* do only some marketing


---
# closing thoughts
---
* this is just one way to make an app
* go through this process, make changes if neccessary
