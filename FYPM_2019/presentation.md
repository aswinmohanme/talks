# August 12 - 14
* Tons of Requests

* Tons of Contributors

## Kerala Flood Map
* A website for getting the locations of the people who needs rescue.

* Also gets the current location of the rescuer so the nearest person who needs rescue can easily be found out

* Uses firebase to track requests

* Independent of Kerala Rescue

# August 16 - First Half
* Still independent of Kerala Rescue

* Still working with an external database

* Still usimg Google Maps for displaying the Map
